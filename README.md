## THIS PROJECT EXPLAINS IN A SIMPLE AND STEP-BY-STEP MANNER HOW A DECISION TREE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IS BUILT AND USED WITH PYTHON USING TOOLS SUCH AS VS CODE, JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, AND THE SCIKIT-LEARN LIBRARY, WHILE CHATGPT IS USED AS A LEARNING ASSISTANT TO MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. THE PROJECT STARTS BY SETTING UP THE REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT, WHICH INCLUDES INSTALLING PYTHON, VS CODE, AND THE NECESSARY EXTENSIONS LIKE PYTHON AND JUPYTER SO THAT CODE CAN BE WRITTEN AND EXECUTED SMOOTHLY INSIDE VS CODE. A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FILE IS USED BECAUSE IT ALLOWS WRITING CODE IN SMALL SECTIONS CALLED CELLS AND SHOWS THE OUTPUT IMMEDIATELY BELOW EACH CELL, WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL FOR BEGINNERS. FOR THIS PROJECT, THE IRIS DATASET IS USED, WHICH IS A FAMOUS DATASET IN MACHINE LEARNING AND IS DIRECTLY AVAILABLE IN THE SCIKIT-LEARN LIBRARY, SO THERE IS NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD EXTERNAL FILES. THIS DATASET CONTAINS MEASUREMENTS OF FLOWERS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING CATEGORIES, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR LEARNING CLASSIFICATION. THE DATASET IS THEN DIVIDED INTO INPUT FEATURES AND OUTPUT LABELS, AFTER WHICH IT IS SPLIT INTO TRAINING AND TESTING DATA SO THAT THE MODEL CAN LEARN FROM ONE PART OF THE DATA AND BE TESTED ON NEW, UNSEEN DATA. A DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER IS CREATED AND TRAINED USING THE TRAINING DATA, WHERE THE MODEL LEARNS TO MAKE DECISIONS BY SPLITTING DATA BASED ON FEATURE VALUES IN A TREE-LIKE STRUCTURE THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. AFTER TRAINING, PREDICTIONS ARE MADE ON THE TEST DATA AND ACCURACY IS CALCULATED TO SEE HOW WELL THE MODEL PERFORMS. ONE IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT IS VISUALIZING THE DECISION TREE, WHICH SHOWS HOW THE MODEL MAKES DECISIONS STEP BY STEP. CHATGPT IS USED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT TO EXPLAIN CONCEPTS, HELP WRITE CLEAN AND COMMENTED CODE, AND SOLVE ERRORS, ACTING LIKE A GUIDE OR TUTOR. FINALLY, THE COMPLETED NOTEBOOK IS UPLOADED TO GITHUB, MAKING THE PROJECT EASY TO SHARE AND USEFUL FOR LEARNING, ACADEMIC SUBMISSION, AND FUTURE REFERENCE. THIS PROJECT SHOWS HOW MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE BUILT IN REAL LIFE AND HOW DECISION TREES ARE USED IN AREAS LIKE HEALTHCARE, FINANCE, EDUCATION, AND BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLE AND EASY TO EXPLAIN.CONCLUSION: PYTHON, VSCODE, JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, CHATGPT ARE THE TOOLS USED AND SCIKIT-LEARN, PANDAS, NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB ARE THE LIBRARIES USED, AND IRIS DATASET IS USED FROM THE KAGGLE PLATFORM, AND DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER IS A MODEL WHICH IS USED IN THIS PROJECT. THE OUTCOME OF THIS TASK WILL BE MODEL TRAINING, EVALUATION, AND VISUALIZATION. THE REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS ARE HEALTHCARE, FINANCE, EDUCATION, BUSINESS ANALYTICS.
